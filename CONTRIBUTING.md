## Build locally

### Prerequisite
The Biophonie application heavily relies on Mapbox SDK. 
Thus, building this repository requires to have an account on [Mapbox](https://account.mapbox.com/).

### Setting up the repository
Clone the git repository:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:DesignandHuman/biophonie.git
```

### Using soundwave
Soundwave is a library used to play and record sounds in the shape of wave forms. It is mandatory to build it alongside Biophonie so, you will need to clone the repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Haransis/WaveFormPlayer.git
```
Then you will need to set the [Soundwave Directory](#soundwave-directory).

_Note :construction: : In the future, this dependency will be made available in a Maven Repository._ 

### Configuring the project
Before building, the project needs to be configured. A couple of configurations need to be in place before
a successful build and test run can be made. Define the following environment variables in the global Gradle Properties (located in `$USER_HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties`).
The following steps describe how to define the related environmental variables needed to build the project:
* [`MAPBOX_DOWNLOAD_TOKEN`](#mapbox-download-token)
* [`MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`](#mapbox-access-token)
* [`STYLE_URL`](#mapbox-style-url)
* [`SOUNDWAVE_DIRECTORY`](#soundwave-directory)
* [`BIOPHONIE_DEBUG_API_URL`](#debug-api-url)

#### Mapbox Download Token
The `MAPBOX_DOWNLOAD_TOKEN` is a Mapbox access token, used during compile time, with a scope set to `DOWNLOADS:READ`.
This token allows to download all required Mapbox dependencies from a Mapbox Maven instance.
The `DOWNLOADS:READ` scope can be set when creating a new access token on https://account.mapbox.com/.
The token configuration can be found in the root `build.gradle.kts` of the project.

#### Mapbox Access token
The `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` is a mapbox access token, packaged as part of test application, to load Mapbox tiles and resources.
This token can be configured on https://account.mapbox.com/ and doesn't require any specific scopes.

#### Mapbox style URL
The `STYLE_URL` is a URL pointing to a mapbox style. It is of the form: `mapbox://styles/OWNER/HASH`
The style used in the production app is based upon the [creation of Geoffrey Dorne](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/geoffreydorne/cjy30xoii1tid1crv9bz19hct.html?title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiZ2VvZmZyZXlkb3JuZSIsImEiOiJpTHBzT3l3In0.9emvgijE_t5EXwWrfemapA&zoomwheel=true&fresh=true#14.04/48.88576/7.1762)
but you can use any style such as a standard one: `mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v11`.

#### Soundwave Directory
The `SOUNDWAVE_DIR` is the path to the directory containing the soundwave library. 
It can be found in the [WaveFormPlayer repository](https://github.com/Haransis/WaveFormPlayer/tree/master/soundwave) (see also [Installing the dependency](#installing-the-dependency)).

#### Debug API URL
This `BIOPHONIE_DEBUG_API_URL` is a URL pointing to the external API you want to use for debug version (see [Communicate with the remote API](#communicate-with-the-remote-api) to learn how to use your own).
The API is needed to find geolocated sounds, record and upload them. You can find the code of the api [here](https://github.com/Haransis/biophonie-api).

#### example global `gradle.properties`
```properties
MAPBOX_DOWNLOAD_TOKEN=sk.eyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.eyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
BIOPHONIE_STYLE_URL=mapbox://styles/user/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SOUNDWAVE_DIR=/home/user/AndroidStudioProjects/WaveFormPlayer/soundwave
# use a local instance of biophonie-api from an emulator
BIOPHONIE_DEBUG_API_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8080
```

## Communicate with the remote API
The production API is located at https://biophonie.fr/.
The preproduction API will be soon available (track progress [here](https://github.com/DesignandHuman/biophonie/issues/33)).
To do your own testing, please clone the [biophonie-api repository](https://github.com/Haransis/biophonie-api) and launch your own instance of it using docker.

## Checks
A precommit hook checks for the respect of [`ktfmt`](https://github.com/facebook/ktfmt) and [`detekt`](https://github.com/detekt/detekt).
Automatic formatting is done using the command:
```
$ ./gradlew ktfmtFormat
```
You can add exceptions to `detekt` with: `app/detekt-baseline.xml` or with `@SupressWarnings("RULENAME")`.
:warning: Beware, changes that do not justify any exception to linters will be automatically rejected.

Other than that, the project do not have any testing implemented yet (track progress [here](https://github.com/DesignandHuman/biophonie/issues/34)).
In the meantime, you should test your modifications by hand.

## Architecture
The project follows the recommended Android architecture guidelines and especially the type of modules described [here](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization/patterns#types-of-modules).
Module dependency graphs are available in the README of each module.
If architecture changes are required, execution of `scripts/generateModuleGraphs.sh` regenerates the corresponding graphs.

## Commit
This repository follows the [gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji) convention. 
A commit title should start with an emoji. See the [website](https://gitmoji.dev/) or use the [gitmoji-cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli) to find the adequate emoji. Here are the main emojis that should be used but feel free to use the ones [listed](https://gitmoji.dev/) that fit better your needs:
* :sparkles: : new feature
* :lipstick: : ui change
* :recycle: : refactoring
* :bug: : bug fix
* :memo: : documentation change

Next is a sentence starting with a verb starting with a minuscule letter and ending without any dot. The title should be as precise as possible.

Optionnaly, a commit message can be added. It should tell a story about the what, how and why a change is happening. It can also contain the issue that it solves.

Wrong commit title `Fix issue with crash of application.`

Correct commit title `:bug: init imageUri to prevent NullPointerEx`

## Pull Requests
Pull requests should follow the [corresponding template](https://github.com/DesignandHuman/biophonie/tree/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST/pull_request_template.md).
Their title should follow the same convention as the [commits](#commit).
