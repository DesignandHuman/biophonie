# Biophonie

## What is it ?
"Biophony" is one of the terms invented by Bernie Krause. The biophony refers to the acoustic signatures generated by any organism in a defined environment. Along with geophony (geophysical origin) and anthropophony (human-produced), they form a conceptual framework of soundscape ecology.

This application aims to allow people of all horizons to record and share with everybody a sound produced by a natural environment.

(Note that you are able to compile and test it by yourself.
Every action performed is "emulated" locally.)

## What's next ?
The application needs a remote API to be fully functional. It will store and communicate with Biophonie's users.
