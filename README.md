# Biophonie

## What is it ?
"Biophony" is one of the terms invented by [Bernie Krause](https://web.archive.org/web/20111111224053/http://www.wildsanctuary.com/niche.pdf). The biophony refers to the acoustic signatures generated by any organism in a defined environment. Along with geophony (geophysical origin) and anthropophony (human-produced), they form a conceptual framework of soundscape ecology.

This application aims to allow people of all horizons to record and share with everybody a sound produced by a natural environment.
